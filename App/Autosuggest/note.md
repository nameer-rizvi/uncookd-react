## On using <UL /> & <LI /> vs. <Datalist /> & <Option />

Though the behavior and functionality of the Autosuggest result list is very similar to that of a <datalist />, there are some clashing requirements, none bigger than <datalist /> being a list of options that are "pre-defined" vs. the server-side fetched list items that're currently in use... Plus, generally, there's much more control over a custom data list component, like the one developed here... In conclusion, <datalist /> will be much more useful for different purposes.
